## General Information
This project was created with the intention of solving a common problem faced by small and medium-sized businesses: the difficulty of managing sales, inventory, and transaction history efficiently. Many businesses still rely on manual methods or outdated tools, which often leads to errors, wasted time, and poor visibility over their operations. On the other hand, most commercial POS systems available on the market tend to be costly or overly complex, making them inaccessible or impractical for smaller shops.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, intuitive, and efficient Point of Sale (POS) frontend that centralizes essential business operations. Through its main modules—sales, inventory management, and sales history—it allows users to process transactions, view and update product details, adjust stock levels, and review past records, all from a clean and easy-to-use interface.

I undertook this project not only to build a practical tool but also as a way to apply and strengthen my skills in modern web development technologies such as Angular and Tailwind. Beyond being a learning experience, this project also serves as a foundation for a scalable POS system that could be expanded and adapted to real-world business needs, offering a lightweight alternative to more expensive solutions.
